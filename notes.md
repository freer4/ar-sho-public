### Retcon

*Some details that should be updated that would complicate the other lore*

**Lifespan**

The Tau are a technologically advanced humanoid race with the established capability to *clone new limbs* and mostly live in relatively healthy conditions. For them to live to be 90 terran years at the most is laughable. 

Approximate Tau life span is adjusted to be 160 years. 

There may be a way to work in the Ethereal control to wearing down some life span to account for shorter lifespans within the Tau Empire.

### Major secret plot points 

**The Old One**

One "Old One" stayed behind to try to repair some of the damage the War in Heaven did to the galaxy. He holds his race responsible for the creation of the Chaos Gods.

He is accompanied by a contingent of loyal seperatist Eldar who have been by his side since, helping him accomplish his goals. 

Tzeentch perceives many of the machinations of the Old One. He is desperate to find and remove his influence from the galaxy. The Old One is (nearly) on par with Tzeentch in his ability to spin complex plots. Essentially, where Tzeentch plots and schemes to consume the galaxy for Chaos, the Old One works in reality to drive out Chaos. 

He is the one who convinced the Emperor of Mankind to try to reunite humanity and pull it back from its dark age. The manner which he did so was the still the work of the Emperor. The Emperor's hatred for xenos is massively overstated in the lore - he only directly fought to reclaim human worlds from xenos control, and many xenos were simply asked to leave. *Need to check if there's enough wiggle room in the lore for this*

The Old One is still able to sometimes confer with the Emperor telepathically with the help of his Eldar loyalists. As a result, the enterred Emperor of Mankind is the one that created the Startide Nexus after the Old One asked for help to save the souls trapped there. 

He wants to free the Emperor from his imprisonment, recognizing it as the Chaos scheme to keep humanity in shambles to feed the Chaos Gods with fear, blood, and sufferring that it is. To that end, he was responsible for organizing the Ork assault of Terra and the great Ork mind that nearly accomplished it. 

The Tau's rise is a relatively new plot of the Old One. Where the Eldar have a strong warp presense, the Old One needed an army that had such a weak presense that Chaos would have difficulty infiltrating their ranks. 

He happened upon the Tau, who were perfect for the job as a species. However, they were disorganized, primitive, and on the verge of wiping themselves out. Even should they have survived their own wars, they were so far behind the other races that they would likely be wiped out before they made it out into the galaxy. 

Risking drawing the attention of Chaos, but knowing the Gods were busy with other endeavors, he used ancient defensive technology that had not been employed in eons, creating a temporary (a couple dozen millenia temporary) barrier known now as the Damocles Gulf. His Loyalist Eldar gathered a few Tau from their planet and explained to them the nature of their mission. They were told that the Tau had the potential to spread the philosophy of the "Greater Good" (an anethema to the chaotic nature of the galaxy that feeds the Chaos Gods) though they were not told directly of the Chaos forces. The Tau would need leaders to bring them together and help them reach out into the stars. 

The first generation were genetically altered and  implanted with a organ in their faces that attach to their brain and vocal cords. Through pheremones they create a sense of trust and ease to their fellow Tau, and with unique vocal harmonics they can leverage that peheremone high to be highly suggestive to their bretheren. The Loyalist Eldar gifted them with a device that would incubate and implant the organs, which lives in deep secret in a sacred ethereal temple on Tau. 

New base ethereal are created through specific inter-caste breeding - Fire male with Earth female and retaining the male offspring, Water female with Air male and retaining the female offspring, then breeding those two. Ethereals can also safely breed amongst themselves, but they do not have the raw numbers to sustain a genetically stable population on their own. The intercaste breeding stock are also kept in secret, living out their lives in a gilded cage inside that same sacred ethereal temple.  

**Tau Blanks**

Although they do not fully understand why, no cross-caste children outside the strict ethereal breeding regimine are allowed to live. Mostly this is handled by taboo and direct orders to not breed amongst the castes - for the part of doctors, the earth caste medical units believe this is for eugenics purposes. Otherwise, ethereals secretly track down and kill the undesireable Tau, even as infants. 

Some (very, very rare) of these interbred offspring out of the specified order are Blanks. While the ethereal control is not psychically based, the same genetics changes that keep a Blank safe from the immaterium prevent the Tau mind control from having effect. While blanks could be useful against chaos, the Old One perceives them as a threat to the Greater Good he's bestowed upon the Tau. *There needs to be a better reason for this to make sense - blanks would be good against Chaos, in theory. Maybe he's afraid that the blanks have an alternate function for the necrons/C'tan*
