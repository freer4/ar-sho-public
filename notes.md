### Retcon

*Some details that should be updated that would complicate the other lore*

**Lifespan**

The Tau are a technologically advanced humanoid race with the established capability to *clone new limbs* and mostly live in relatively healthy conditions. For them to live to be 90 terran years at the most is laughable. 

Approximate Tau life span is adjusted to be 160 years. 

There may be a way to work in the Ethereal control to wearing down some life span to account for shorter lifespans within the Tau Empire.
