### Shas'nel E'taro Lynu'nan 

*Fireblade of the Ar'sho Sept, Sharp-Agressive Mind, Steadfast Blade*

*Known for her keen intellect and her tendency to act aggressively in her youth. Formerly a pathfinder. Lynu'nan won respect and quickly climbed the ranks after successfully defending a remote colony from an Ork Waaagh, being gifted an equalizer after using it to save the life of Aun'sahe in that battle. She then fought in the War of Southern Consolidation, rising to command all infantry of the Shan'al, second only to O'Soove.*

*After Ea'sho incident, she quickly became the symbolic leader of the Ar'sho Enclaves. While the Enclave is organized by the Kar'ken Council, the people still look to her as their source of inspiration.*

Shas'nel Lynu'nan is a single fireblade model equipped with a Light Rail Rifle, Pulse Pistol, and the Kar'vesa. 

#### Kar'vesa (Equal-hand)

*Crafted from her prized Equalizer, Lynunan had the weapon tailored to the Fire Caste martial combat she has long mastered. It is now integrated into her armor, resting in the palm of her hand. Its force-multiplying properties deliver crushing blows even to armored opponents.*

#### Volley Fire

Models in AR'SHO SEPT units within 6" of a friendly Lynu'nan may fire an extra shot with pulse pistols, pulse carbines, pulse rifles, and light rail rifles when shooting at a target within half the weapon's range.
