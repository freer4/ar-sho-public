### Aun'O Ar'sho Sahe Sarai

*Ethereal Commander of the Ar'sho Sept, Self Disciplined, Severed Control*

*Having severed his control of his bretheren to join with the Ar'sho, Aun'Sahe is the only ethereal to serve among their ranks. A combat veteran, he insists on being deployed to the front lines to prove his service to the Tau'va is as strong as anyone's.* 

Aun'Sahe is a single armored ethereal equiped with a hover pack (counts as hover drone) and dual equalizers. 

#### Failure is Not an Option

TAU EMPIRE Units within 6" of a friendly ETHEREAL may use the Ethereal's Leadership characteristic instead of their own when taking Morale tests. 

#### Dakran'ka (The brave ending blow)

At the beginning of the fight phase, models in AR'SHO SEPT units within 6" of a friendly Aun'Sahe may fire their pistols at a unit they charged this turn as though they had not moved, regardless of whether the charge was successful. They must subtract 1 from their balistic skill for these attacks. 

**Justification**

For fluff purposes, Aun'Sahe prefers to be on the front lines and his presence is an inspiration to all.

Rule wise, the extra shots in a charge can be devestating and give this sept the ability to do some damage in that phase beyond what you typically see with Tau. However, it is costly as everyone firing must have taken a pulse pistol to begin with, which is rarely useful otherwise. Aun'Sahe would have to be within 6" AFTER the unit charged, so he's going to be in or near the fray. Tau still get clobbered in close combat - while you might take down a few unarmored foes in the charge, the low WS and S of fire warriors is going to get them all dead in short order. It's very risky, but as the name implies it's best suited to finishing off an already weakend foe.

The -1 to BS is because "running and shooting" and also for some balance. Will need playtesting

Synergy-wise, add in a cadre fireblade and the double pistol shots are that much more effective - though they would need to be fairly near the charge as well

**Ying & Yang** (Balance of life)
