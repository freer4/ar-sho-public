# Ksi'Lynunan

## Shas'nel Ar'sho E'taro Lynu'nan, Ksi'Ar'sho

*Fireblade of the Ar'sho Sept, Sharp-Agressive Mind, Steadfast Blade - Root of the Ar'sho. Commonly shortened to Ksi'Lynunan or Lynunan*

*Known for her keen intellect and her tendency to act aggressively in her youth. Formerly a pathfinder. Lynu'nan won respect and quickly climbed the ranks after successfully defending a remote colony from an Ork Waaagh, being gifted an equalizer after using it to save the life of Aun'sahe in that battle. She then fought in the War of Southern Consolidation, rising to command all infantry of the Shan'al, second only to O'Kakaushi.*

*After Ea'sho incident, she quickly became the symbolic leader of the Ar'sho Enclaves, being named Ksi for her role in its formation. While the Enclave is organized by the Kar'ken Council, the people still look to her as their source of inspiration.*

Ksi'Lynunan is a single model equipped with a [Light Rail Rifle](/codex/Wargear/Light_Rail_Rifle.html), Pulse Pistol, and the Kar'vesa. She is accompanied by two MV52 Shield Drones. Only one of this unit may be included in your army.

## Discussion

As the main protagonist and hero of the Ar'sho, I wanted her to be fairly powerful and with a point cost to reflect it. 2+BS with volley fire and a Light Rail Rifle by default, she's pretty baller. Chance to make those shots -2 or -3 AP. Decent enough melee to not get wrecked by literally anything. 

She will also have one more ability I'm toying around with. Bear with me!
