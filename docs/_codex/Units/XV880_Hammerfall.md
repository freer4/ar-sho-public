## Discussion

Concept unit
- Crisis chassis 
- Burst Rail Rifle 
- Missile Pod
- Can replace Missile Pod with Airbursting Fragmentation Projector
- Target Lock
- No iridium option
- Shas'vre option
- Taken in pairs. Maybe up to 3 pairs per unit?

The "Baby Broadside", this unit is light and manueverable like a Crisis team. Without Iridium or shield generator, it's not going to do well when shot at, and it's going to be expensive. High-ranged weapons preference, taking the rail+missile weapons pairing as default, but able to switch out the missiles for the AFP, giving it that "shoot things it can't see" effect of the SMS on Broadsides and a slight point reduction to help fit these into lists. 

Basic use is "get into position quickly at the edge of combat, provide fire support." 

This unit is still in **very** early stage development.
