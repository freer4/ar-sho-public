# XV102 Thunderstrike

Someday, when money is no object, we are going to kitbash some more expensive units into a terrifying heavy-weapons platform that looks something like a Riptide got frisky with a Taunar. 

Railguns (heavy rail rifles?) overhead on a turret. A monstrosity that is basically 5x airbursting fragmentation projector on one arm. Cyclic ion raker on the other, behind a sheild generator. A pair of smart missile systems on each shoulder. Massive thrusters. 

Way too much firepower with a huge points cost. Just for fluffy, because-we-can reasons. 

This page is mostly so we can keep track of that dream. Feel free to send us pics of your crazy conversions!
