# E'taro's Burning

{% include ability.html item="EtarosBurning" lore=true %}

This trait is only available on [Ksi'Lynunan](/codex/Characters/Lynunan.html) and per the [Ar'sho Sept Rules](/codex/Rules/Sept_Rules.html#ksilynunans-veterans) on up to three Strike Teams.

## Discussion

It makes Strike Team lists significantly more effective if they land their hits and wound well. Combined with [Light Rail Rifles](/codex/Wargear/Light_Rail_Rifle.html) you essentially get a Pulse Rifle with potential for -3AP, but it's very costly to do so. Since they're not available with other Sept Tenets and unaffected by Pulse Accelerator Drones you're also stuck with the 30" max range.

The +1A is mostly fluff. Combined with some of the other rules it's potentially useful, but it's not turning your S3 Fire Warriors into Space Marines or anything of that nature.
