## Discussion

Bringing back the classic twin-linked mechanic, but with a little less suspension of disbelief. This should be pretty useful in a variety of situations, and helps compensate for that 4+ on the crisis.

Usefullness will be weighted against your markerlight usage. Markerlights give you that reroll 1s already, putting this to rerolling 1/3 of shots. With the potential +1BS you're only rerolling 2s with this.

- For the points, if you're dropping a fusion crisis-bomb you can reroll your 2 fusion blasters pretty reliably as you'll be in close. For the lower points cost than a third fusion, is it worth the reroll? You tell me.
- On the flip side, a couple of burst cannons that can reroll all 8 shots, versus just 12 flat-out shots? 
- On a missileside - Why take anything else? Hmm... maybe this is overpowered in this situation. Makes me wish that heavy rail rifle was two weapons though! 

1 Should this be full-range, or is that overpowered?
2 I get that Crisis suits are overpriced already, so trying to balance this against other Crisis systems, not other units - Tau or otherwise.
