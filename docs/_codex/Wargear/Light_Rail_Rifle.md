## Discussion

Add a -1AP and a chance for -2AP to your Strike Teams for 3 points per model. This sept does get the extra shot at half range for these particular weapons, but as rails weapons they do NOT get the buff from pulse accellerator drones and you can't take Darkstrider without the Tau sept, so it looses some chances for other buffs.
