## Discussion

Fluff-wise, specialized gravity drives on both the projectiles and the suit interact to form a strong sustained force at short range, using the projectiles more like you are throwing a hammer at your foe than shooting them.

Toughen up your Crisis unit and get them in close for some high-risk, high-reward short-range combat. Where the Fusion Blaster excels at blasting away heavy armor, this weapon is designed for tough units with light or no armor.

- For stats, 4 hits seems reasonable. 
- Might need to up the range to 8" (flamer-like). 
- Up to 10S if you advanced this turn, bringing down your BS slightly but guaranteeing that 2+ wound on most any infantry.
- D3 damage to keep it competitive, giving you a wound potential of 12 - 24 if you're crazy lucky with those 6s. 
- Not terribly effective against anything with a decent armor save.
- The extra wounds are fantastic for getting you into combat, but you immediately start losing effectiveness if you're sustaining hits.
