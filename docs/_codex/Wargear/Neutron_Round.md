# Neutron Round

*Highly-specialized rounds containing heavy element lattices methodically arranged at an atomic level use the sheer force of impact of the heavy rail rifle round to trigger nuclear supercriticality*

## Discussion

This might be super overpowered. It's a fluffy concept I've been working on for some time - the tactical nuclear railgun. **Feedback is appreciated**: alternative ability suggestions, balance suggestions, mathhammer, etc..

#### Pros

4-12 mortal wounds on one unit of your choice, and a few mortal wounds to everyone else nearby. Is that enough pro for you?

#### Cons

- Only get one rail shot instead of two. For the target unit, it's actuall possible to roll 14 wounds max with the heavy rail rifle, so technically this ability lowers your wound potential. 
- Even if you hit, it's only a 50/50 shot of triggering the ability
- Costs a CP and can only use once per turn
