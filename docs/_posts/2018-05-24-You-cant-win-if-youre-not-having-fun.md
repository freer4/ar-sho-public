I am so excited to hear that a Tau army won a major tournament! Revel in the jubilation of the fish making it to the top of the food chain and look forward to surely being nerfed in short ord... 

*Ohhhhh*

The winner cheated.

Far be it for me to condemn someone without reviewing the evidence myself, but the general consensus seems to be he was playing pretty dirty.

That's not what competition is about. I've been taught my whole life, and practice and preach as an adult, that you never fight fair when it comes down to it. But this isn't a fight - this is a *__game__* about fighting. Cheese if you must, crush your enemies, see them driven (off the table) before you, *hear the lament of their women as they rethink their armies and buy all new models with the kids' college funds*. 

But don't cheat. 

Also don't be a jerk. If you're in a place in your life where you're so determined to win a tabletop game that you are cheating or playing with a lack of sportsmanship, you need to step back and re-examine yourself. 

That's not to bash anyone. We can all get a little caught up and obsessed with things from time to time. I've done it - have you seen this website? Do you have any idea how many times I've rebuilt this already?

You need to find some harmony in your life. I know, at least in my community, the players are really great people. I go to hang out on game nights even if I'm not up for playing, just to watch and chat. If you find yourself too deep into it, or spending too much time on the hobby, step back. We'll still be here when you come back.

## In too deep

Now... what constitutes too much time? We all have varying schedules and responsibilities, and that's okay. One of the many great things about this hobby is that you can play at your own pace in your own time. 

**Too much time** is when you are *shirking responsibilities to indulge in the hobby.* **Too much time** is when you are *turning down opportunities to do something that isn't time-sensitive.* Can you paint that unit tomorrow if you go out with your friends tonight instead? 

It's a nice day, if you go outside to play ball with your kids, can you kitbash that Coldstar later when the weather isn't so beautiful? That's a serious decision I made this week.

Are you in this hobby to distract yourself from a poor life situation - rough home life, bad breakup, literally any part of pubescence? That's perfectly alright. This hobby makes a fine escape from those things for a time. It requires focus, dedication, attention to detail, thoughtfulness... so many great things you can take away. 

But is it dominating your life in such a way that other things are getting *worse* as a **result** of your hobby? Are you neglecting relationships? *Are you neglecting yourself?* Are you so defined by the hobby that you **have** to be the best? 

__Do you *want* to win, or do you *need* to win?__

That's the question you need to meditate on, to seek an honest answer from yourself for yourself. 

## But I want to win

Itâ€™s good to *want* to win. The opposite extreme of obsession is neglect. If this hobby is something you truly enjoy - and only you can decide if you do or not - then do not neglect it. Other responsibilities may take priority, but having some enjoyment and fulfillment in your life is still important. 

Schedule time to build, to paint, to play. Play the impulsive pick-up game when it comes along. Write insanely involved backstories for your tiny plastic army. 

*Just do not let it dominate who you are.*

Harmony in life is paramount. All things in moderation, including moderation.
