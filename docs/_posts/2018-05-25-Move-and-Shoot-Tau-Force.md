My current thought is a list that can move-and-shoot, staying just a little mobile with most and very mobile with the rest of its forces. Markerlights and other shooting synergies I believe are key. 

## Range and power

Starting with a spearhead detachment. Lots of markerlight drones because they can move and shoot their markerlights, in small units for the sept reroll bonus. A single crisis unit with a drone controller to accompany them, the rest of the weapons set for long-range engagement. Mix those in with three separate singe-model Railside units and see rerolls for days, with a necessity for enough markerlights to ensure move-and-shoot capabilities on the Heavy Rail Rifles and hopefully enough to get that sweet +1BS. 

Round the detachment out with my Coldstar commander running "screw-you" level assault firepower at -1AP, advancing 40 and shooting freely, with an Onager because punching tanks sounds fun.

## Guns galore (and more rail rifles!)

Two pathfinder units with 3 rail rifles each, six strike teams, and a fireblade provide 11 markerlights to this detachment. Pulse accellerators and sept tenet give fantastic range to the strike teams. The necessary fireblade and ethereal buffs play nicely. Just enough markerlight usage to make the situation dangerous, and enough shots to make enemies think twice about charging in. 

A second commander, just because the plasma sounds like fun, especially with the extended range. Gives this detachment just a little bit more ranged -AP goodness. 

## Construction

I have two XV-88 Broadsides currently, so I will need to get one more to complete this list. Otherwise, it's based on models I already have. This is for local game night, so it's not using the Ar'sho special rules at the moment. Many of these models I plan to use for narrative games later. 

I do have a few points to fill out for a 2k list. I might try for another pathfinder squad and a couple more strike teams. I may also try to add in a Paranah unit for swift strikes, shake things up with a breacher squad or two in a devilfish, or invest in some stealth suits for flavor.
