This blog serves as a catalog of my journey with Warhammer 40,000 and writing science fiction. Follow the Ar'sho Enclave on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Arsho-Enclave-171552993545731/) or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/arshoenclave) for regular updates when we post new articles! 

Also check out the [short stories](/stories/) I've written about the characters' origins and feel free to utilize my fluff [Tau supplemental codex](/codex/) for your narrative games. 

Enjoy, for the Tau'va!
